# C++ Competitive Editor Icon
# This is a placeholder for the application icon
# In a real application, you would place a proper 256x256 PNG icon file here
# The icon should represent C++ programming and competitive programming
# Suggested design: A stylized C++ logo with lightning bolt or trophy elements
